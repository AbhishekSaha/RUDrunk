RUDrunk
=======

My first published app on the Android App Store, able to be downloaded here:  bit.ly/RUDrunk


This app was created from the ground up for the Android platform. It is designed for college students who may have fought a battle for their sobriety, and lost. Instead of walking through the dark and dangerous streets of New Brunswicks and end up on a crime alert, use this application to get home safely. RUDrunk will track the address of your current location via your phone's GPS and location services, and then call a cab for you automatically. No dialing is required, all of it is taken care for you. 

RUDrunk also offers a simple test to take to test whether or not you are drunk. (Not scientifically proven) However, if you do fail this test, you probably are in no position to get home anyway; failure of the test will trigger the phone's GPS to show you your current address and call the cab for you immediately. 

Be safe out there, and make sure to have RUDrunk on your phone.
